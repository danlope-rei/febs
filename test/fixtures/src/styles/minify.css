	These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to
	explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly
	go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize the homing signal. Each
	unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light,
	in a protective field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced
	chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000
	percent.

	Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. According to coordinates,
	we have travelled 7,000 light years and are located near the system J-25. Tractor
	beam released, sir. Force field maintaining our hull integrity. Damage report?
	Sections 27, 28 and 29 on decks four, five and six destroyed. Without our shields,
	at this range it is probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.

	Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration.
	Force fields have been established on all turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer,
	run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems. Antimatter containment positive.
	Warp drive within normal parameters. I read an ion trail characteristic of a
	freighter escape pod. The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some
	unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.

	We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece
	of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging
	from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if I've
	said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides
	an abundance of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.

	Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has
	been invaded by an unknown microorganism. The organisms fuse to the nerve,
	intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the transporter's biofilters
	couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM
	state. The engineering section's critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes
	contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.

	Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes.
	Something strange on the detector circuit. The weapons must have disrupted our
	communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat, but inorganically materialized
	out of patterns used by our transporters. Captain, the most elementary and
	valuable statement in science, the beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All
	transporters off.

	Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar
	flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar
	006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Total
	guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield
	effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a
	spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time.

	Resistance is futile.
